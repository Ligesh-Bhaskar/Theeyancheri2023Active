**Active Dynamics of Linear Chains and Rings in Porous Media**

**[J. Chem. Phys. 159, 014902 (2023)](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/159/1/014902/2900731/Active-dynamics-of-linear-chains-and-rings-in?searchresult=1)**

Polymer_COM.cpp: C++ code to compute the center of mass of the polymers. 

Polymer_COM_MSD.cpp: C++ code to compute the center of mass MSD of the polymers.

Time_Exponent.cpp: C++ code to compute the time exponents of MSDs. 

Radius_gyration_tensor.cpp: C++ code to compute the radius of gyration tensor of the polymers.

RG_ACF.cpp: C++ code to compute the radius of gyration autocorrelation function. 

Note: Asphericity can be calculated from the radius of gyration tensor eigen values.
